## IMPORTANT NOTE: 
eval() allows you to execute a string of code as if it were actual JavaScript code.
While it is a useful tool, it is a security risk. I would recommend using eval() ONLY for learning purposes and not any actual production code.


## Calculator
This is a JavaScript project program where we will build a functioning calculator.
